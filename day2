Day 1 has concluded with over a dozen new inhabitants moving in, and a similar amount of districts being formed. The history log of day 1 has been archived and will be available to view on Github in a few days.

It appears as though collaboration and progression is largely not being favored, with most inhabitants opting to create new districts rather than building on existing ones.

[b]üëÅÔ∏è Overlord Council[/b] has picked out a few honorable mentions who worked towards prosperity and will award them accordingly. They also grants the world a [b]City Hall[/b] which unlocks the [b]World Committee[/b] and [b]Laws.[/b]

- [b]Kobold84[/b] founded the University in Japan, making it currently the only literate and educated district.
- [b]boat[/b] founded the Central Bank in the Financial District, providing the world with an economy.
- [b]Blushing[/b] founded the Forest District and reformed it in to the worlds official City Park.

[b]üëÅÔ∏è Overlord Council[/b] awards [b]Kobold84[/b], [b]boat[/b] and [b]Blushing[/b] each a default seat on the World Committee.

The three aforementioned inhabitants now serve as the legislative body of the world and possess the ability to enact new laws. They will retain this privilege until the dawn of Day 5, at which point democratic World Committee elections will be held.

[b]üëÅÔ∏è Overlord Council[/b] expects the current World Committee to enact laws that will serve to benefit the future legislature and prosperity of the world. As such we have enacted two baseline laws to get you started.

- New laws must be !approved by the majority of World Committee members
- Laws may not directly single out an inhabitant, district or establishment
